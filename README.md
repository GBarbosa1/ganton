A hotkey software, for now.
Ganton is a hotkey software to help me cycle between assets in a Homebrooker.
Since I do keep +100 under radar typing each one code in a Homebrooker is kinda of a exhausting task.
Ganton reads from a "Database" that you can create in a .xlsx file, just keep sure that the data are antry in the "A" column and n+1 lines (you can mod this in the script)
